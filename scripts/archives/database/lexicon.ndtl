    & {(link "Oscean")} is designed to be fully static, to operate without the need for a build process, to remain flexible enough to adapt to my needs as they change, and to technology as it evolves.
    & Each part of this project should aim to persist across technological {(bold "Long Term")}, not one part of it should be prebuilt, precompiled, or minified. — Every method should be {(bold "specific")}, {(bold "unobfuscated")}, and each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.

    * Primitives
    | create | become | enter | leave
    | look   | take   | drop  | move
    | learn  | warp   | use   | edit
    & The goal of this project is to distribute a lightweight operating system that would serve a environment able to {(link "https://twitter.com/neauoire/status/1042644335689261058" "navigate the file system")}, run code and exchange content with other {(link "Parade")} instances, via the basic primitives.
    # create a machine
    # > |
    & There are no "users", "files" or "applications", in this operating system, everything is an operable "vessel". A {(bold "vessel")} is an {(ital "object")} that can act onto other vessels, it has its own permissions. Users are not different from applications or files. A {(ital "user")}, is a vessel being acted upon, possibly containing other vessels. A {(ital "file")} is an inert vessel, that has no applicable actions to itself but may contain text data accessible via the primitives.
    # enter the machine
    # > |
    & A new vessel responds to the basic primitives, and visible vessels might append to that list with actions of their own. The vessel format serves endpoints that responds to actions. For instance, an telephone vessel, might respond to the action {(ital "call")}, as in the command "call Alice".
    & There is no linear hierarchy tree, instead vessels can be within themselves or each other, or even organized in the shape of a loop. Pockets of space can be hosts to vessels existing around a common purpose, or carried around inside another vessel as you would a tool-belt or an inventory, giving the acting vessel, or {(ital "user")}, additional actions appended to the list of primitives.
    # become the machine
    # > |
    & One of the goals of this operating system is to be {(bold "fully operable by voice")}, think {(ital "screenless computing")}. The navigation is designed to be used via simple text commands, there would be nothing quite like windows. Vessels could display passive content when in sight, allowing to create a form of procedural user interface, but the system itself does not have a concept of windows, like you would in a typical graphical operating system with a wm.
    & While the navigation of the system can be done by voice alone, the terminal, when presented on a screen, begins with a {(bold "prompt")}, to which can be appended a {(bold "history of responses")}, or even a {(bold "display area for graphics")} when a vessel is serving a game or a movie.
    # use the machine
    # > |
    & At its core the system should be {(bold "single-threaded")}, and operate a single frame, or a {(ital "state")}, of the world at a time. While passive responses of visible vessels might allow for a kind of oversight, the user experience as a terminal, and down to its functioning should not allow for multi-tasking.
    & The creation of application vessels, think for instance a {(ital "drawing application")}, would be built with the LISP dialect of Parade, which is itself built with that same language. — Making the entire operating system existing it inself as a vessel, editable, changeable, operable and navigable.
    # warp to the lobby@29:03:25:76
    # > |
    & A {(bold "Network of Parade systems")} would be traversible(read-only) by an acting vessel. The Parade's typical behaviours for moving about will persist onto the remote systems so, a vessel can move, enter, use remote vessels and suggest changes to the host world as commits — All the while, respecting the host's vessel permissions. For instance, a vessel might make itself usable by a visiting vessel, but will not let itself be moved or altered.

    & Unlike our last game, text-heavy {(link "Diluvium")}, {(bold "Pico Battle")} is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent's shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon's bullets.

Living at any one place over a period of a year showed a decay in inspiration.

    & My first encounter with a Nomad was during my stay in {(link "Czech" "Prague")}, as {(ital "Santiago")}, I had just met my {(bold "Fulcanelli")}.
    & There was a time in my life when I may have felt homesick. But for now, Home was but a vague concept that existed out there, {(ital "forever fleeting")}.
    & An office is no place a multi-disciplinarist, and {(link "Japan")} was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the skills I longed for.
    & The suffocating curiousity of wanting to know how different my life might be, had gotten worse than the daily frictions of my current situation. The decision of living aboard a {(link "Pino" "float home")} was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas, for it was, at the time, the only solution that would align with what I wanted in life.
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo appartment was of about 1.5K$, and transitioning from it, to a sailboat, implicated some serious downsizing. The way we looked at it was that, within 3 years, our 20K$ sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month — Or that by cutting the costs of our current living situation in half, we could be both "home owners" and keep our traveling options open.
    @ Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go of were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — When the truly hard things to let go of would be the habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your {(link "Marquesas" "desert island")}. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. But at least, you get to spend your day writing. You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day, and time away from social networks really does make you feel better.
    @ Being nomad is trading the things you think you care about, for things you didn't know existed.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & You learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine — Even to live without a fridge and power.
    & We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on desert islands, and we have met the most amazing people.

    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs have access to the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {(ital "Limiting Amino Acids")}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.

LONGTERMISM
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : Notes on {(link)} and sustainability.
  BODY
    & In an age of disposable smart devices and unrepairable electronics, there are few topics that occupy my mind as much as {(bold "solutioning for technological resilience and development longtermism")}.
    & {(link "pino" "Living aboard a sailboat")}, away from reliable internet connectivity and outside of delivery networks, encourages us at {(link "Hundred Rabbits")}, to consider ways in which we can strenghten the toolset onto which we rely, to reflect on novel ways to simplify the systems that we use, and to optimize toward more {(link "solarpunk" "environmentally councious")} practices.
    & We must abandon 3-in-1 packages, bloated always-online services and general planned obsolesce, and establish practices of recyclism, minimum viable products, small-sharp modular utilities. We see smart and resilience as opposing attributes to a device, smart is inherantly contrary to a single purpose tool, and thus incompatible with longtermism.
    & Our focus over the past year has gradually shifted from open-source software, toward modular and combinable electronics. Looking back, we are proud of the open-source tools that we created, enabling a handful of people to exit subscription services, and uninspectable utilities. Moving forward, we are thinking more and more about hardware, or at least to do without the operating system layer.
    & I periodically find myself thinking about operating systems, or more specifically the interaction design of OSes. I attempting to tackle the difficult UX challenges of that space, unrealizing that my failure to solve these issues might very well come from the simple fact that the purpose of operating systems is to enable multi-tasking, multi-tasking that I try to erradicate from my daily life, making these these issues deeply unsolvable and my love for sharp tools and OSes ireconcilable.
    & Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn't re-orient our focus onto things that can run on small low-power open-source boards like Arduinos, but I also consider the impact of pushing for the purchase and production more electronics.
    & Despite all this, I dream of a line of simple electronics, each one designed for a single purpose. Or even for things beyond the realm of electronics, like a kit bike with all its superfluousities removed.
    & My dream sailboat has no diesel engine, no fuel outboard and no lead acid battery storage, but instead a compressed air engine with its compression stored in diving tanks, a bike crank powered compressor, a hydro generator pump, and a dynamo to charge our low-power electronics. The only crutial electronic systems connected to the house tanks would be the AIS transciver, the VHF radio, a basic chartplotter and habitat lighting. Our work and entertainment electronics, like our laptops and cameras, would run off solar charging a minimal array of LiPo batteries.
    & Is there a way to distribute entertainment in a way that is environmentally conscious? I read this thinking, how dare I think that only work has value and that entertainment and leisure has somehow less right to pollute.

AUDIO FAQS
  UNDE : Faqs
  BODY
    + What inspired you to play music?
    & I stumbled on the idea of writing my own music at a chiptune concert, I realized at that moment that I could write music with non-traditional and custom-made instruments.
    + When were you first introduced to chiptune music?
    & At the Gamma Festival in Montreal, Bubblyfish was the first performing chiptune act that I ever saw.
    + What kind of music do you play and why?
    & I tend to navigate the space between ambient and industrial music, I write starkly contrasted rhythmic music as I find it best to describe the environments visited in the songs.
    + What themes are you trying to uncover in your music?
    & Most of the music I write as {(link "Aliceffekt")} is about a character's travels across the frigid scapes of this fictional world called the {(link "Neauismetica")}, on this foreign planet called {(link "Dinaisth")}.
    + Why did you decide to accompany your music with visuals?
    & The visuals came first, and I wrote the music to accompany the drawings. So the music merely accompany the visuals.
    + Do you have a set of tracks you play regularly?
    & I tend to write music for specific events that occur in the Neauismetica, and when I perform live, I pick moments which best fit with the other performers.
    + What is your approach when you perform live?
    & It depends, sometimes it's improvisational, like the {(link "Telekinetic")} show. Or sometimes it's procedural, like the {(link "Ehrivevnv Studies")}, where I merely make sure that everything is tuned properly. Sometimes I mix old songs and focus on building interesting visuals if the venue allows for it. As of late, I have been livecoding, where the song writing is done as a performance.
    + How do you approach songwriting?
    & I tend to write the song in my head entirely, and put it down in one setting. I often write music about the Neauismetica, it's a kind of mental place, a pool of endless musical idea I can visit and explore, it's where most of the songs come from.
    + When performing live, what's your setup like?
    & It varies, I've written a couple of shows to be performed with a specific synth, or a specific hardware like with the LeapMotion. Typically, I just use a combination of midi controllers and livecoding.
    + What instruments do you play?
    & None. I'm not interested in the tactile aspect of music rendition, my love is for composition and synthesis.
    + Where does the name Aliceffekt comes from?
    & Alice Effekt was a {(link "https://youtu.be/VSKXfDMpqns?t=51m8s" "track by Drome")} that I liked a lot when I started writing music. My goal was to write music just like it. But it has since evolved into something else.
VISUAL FAQS
  UNDE : Faqs
  BODY
    + Which creative discipline did you begin with, and how did you shift to other mediums?
    & At first, I stumbled onto photo manipulation. From DeviantArt, to Raster and to Depthcore, I was moving from working with photos, to drawing, and eventually modeling. While I enjoyed visual arts, I felt that to keep sharpening the rendition of the worlds I was drawing, I needed to add a new dimension and so I began writing soundtracks to the pictures, and eventually putting all of it together in the form of websites, and games.
    + What is the meaning of the glyph in your avatar?
    & It is an old rendition of the character for blue, found in the the Shuowen Jiezi, the character dictionary written by Xu Shen, 100 CE. This particular glyph has probably never been used outside of paleography. I found it to be very beautiful, and the word "blue" has a special meaning in the stories from which my handle "neauoire" comes from.
    + What is the significance of your neck tattoo?
    & My tattoo is three dots in the shape of a triangle, or at an equal distance from each other, it signifies audio, visual and research. I call this arrangement "trisight", it's a reminder that, being a generalist, I must constantly pull from these 3 mediums in order to create complete works.
    + Where does your name come from?
    & I began using the name online around 2005, Devine Lu Linvega comes from Davine Lu Linvega of the series "Blame", by Tsutomu Nihei, which was very influential to me at the time.
    + Why did you choose that name?
    & I had been looking for a name that did {(bold "not")} represent who I was, but instead who I would like to become. I wanted something that would serve as a reminder to put curiousity above power, that did not lock myself in the past, but would force me forward toward that ideal.
    + Who is Davine Lu Linvega in the book?
    & She was unique from other antagonists in that she doesn't seem to desire killing humans, instead, she devotes her time and energy into finding a way to access an hyper-evolved version of the Internet in the universe of BLAME. As seen in her dying words, Davine was not motivated by a pursuit for power, but rather wanted to see the Netsphere out of pure curiosity.
RESEARCH FAQS
  UNDE : Faqs
  BODY
    + What are the most important concepts that you impart in your works?
    & A lot of my work deal with foreignness and adaptiveness, some of the most romantic ideas that one will find in my work is that of explorers wandering the remains of a long extinguished civilisation, and trying to make sense of it.
    + Why do you release free software?
    & Being away from accessible internet connectivity, the most practical mean for us to develop and release projects is via {(link "the Bazaar Model")}, where the code is often maintained by others while we are away, and so as to not capitalize unfairly on all the help that we receive, we decided to only accept donations.
    + Why do you release open-source software?
    & Being incapable of sitting through a class back in high-school, most of the learning that I was able to do was from looking at other people's sources and trying to make sense of the way they think and understand the reasons for solutioning in that particular way. For an ecosystem of tools to be truly resilient, individuals must be able to repair, maintain and inspect the software that they use.
    + Why is journaling important to you?
    & I keep records of everything I make, and everything I consume. The idea is to better understand my creative patterns, and to predict changes in mood and interest. Ultimately, the goal is to plan more efficiently, to spend my time with more efficacy and to work less.
LIFESTYLE FAQS
  UNDE : Faqs
  BODY
    + What is your background?
    & I was first interested in illustration and motion graphics. I soon started writing music to complement these pictures, and finally I began implementing interaction and turn these designs into games, websites and tools.
    + Where do you work?
    & I work at a small research studio aboard a sailboat, called Hundred Rabbits, where we do experiments in resilience and self-reliance using low-tech solutions.
    + What do you do during the daytime?
    & The ways in which I spend my time varies wildly from day to day, but mostly experimental research, my interests include alternative ways to store power and minimum viable solutions for technological tooling.
    + What is your routine?
    & I go to bed choosing one thing to accomplish the next day, I wake up to tackle this singular task. I tend to work only in the morning, get everything done before lunch. The afternoons, I spend mostly reading and learning things to help me solve the next day's task. I usually wake up with the sun, and sleep soon after sunset.
    + Where do you go to get inspired?
    & I share a {(link "Merveilles" "small forum")} with a few online friends and whenever I am looking for a new favourite thing, or some help — I know I can find it there. Everyone should build a small network, a place where they can feel comfortable to experiment, show works-in-progress and exchange on the topics of art and science in a safe place among like-minded people.
    + Why do you think people should travel more?
    & I found traveling to be a good catalyst toward learning new languages, for developing an interest in foreign cultures and ultimately for building empathy, curiosity and creativity.
    + How do you draw the line between what is published, and what stays private?
    & Working behind an avatar and living online through a proxy name offers a good healthy distance between the work and the self. The Devine Lu Linvega project focuses on making explicit the reflections, and techniques for the creative process. My intimate life, my health, my friends and family are outside of the scope of this project.

    & {(bold "Tutorials")} are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it.
    - {(bold "Gets the user started")}
    - Allows the user to learn by doing
    - Ensures the user sees results immediately
    - Focuses on concrete steps, not abstract concepts
    & {(bold "How-to guides")} assume some knowledge and understanding, and take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. They are recipes, directions to achieve a specific end - for example: how to create a web form; how to plot a three-dimensional data-set; how to enable LDAP authentication.
    & How-to guides are quite distinct from tutorials. A how-to guide is an answer to a question that a true beginner might not even be able to formulate.
    - {(bold "Solves a problem")}
    - Focuses on results
    - Allows for some flexibility
    & {(bold "Explanations")} can equally well be described as discussions. They are a chance for the documentation to relax and step back from the software, taking a wider view, illuminating it from a higher level or even from different perspectives. You might imagine a discussion document being read at leisure, rather than over the code.
    - {(bold "Explains a choice")}
    - Provides context
    - Discusses alternatives & opinions
    & {(bold "Reference")} guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. They are code-determined, because ultimately that's what they describe: key classes, functions, APIs, and so they should list things like functions, fields, attributes and methods, and set out how to use them.
    - {(bold "Describes the machinery")}
    - References material should be austere and to the point.
    - Structure the documentation around the code
    - Do nothing but describe

    & Its goal is to leads to a less dogmatic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict.
    & Bourland sees specifically the "identity" and "predication" functions as pernicious, but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity. In the case of the "existence" form (and less idiomatically, the "location" form), one might (for example) simply substitute the verb "exists".
    & Other copula-substitutes in English include taste, feel, smell, sound, grow, remain, stay, and turn, among others a user of E-prime might use instead of "to be".

    & Crouched over a heap of cogs, she did not look over as I hung my snow-covered coat on something that, by the look of it, might very well be a time machine. A distracted gaze turned for a moment, perhaps to make sure that I did not break anything as I navigated the busy studio.
    & What I first perceived as a pile of junk turned out to be an intricate clocklike mechanism; where the needles would have been, a small hand rested at the end of a short metallic arm.
    & My friend held a minuscule weight above the tiny hand, before carefully laying it onto its opened palm. Whirring and clicking, a second arm emerged and plucked a gear out from its own ticking body and laid it back into the toolbox at its side. In controlled gestures, activated by the weight, tiny arms dismantled bolts and screws, while carefully putting them in that toolbox, gradually taking the casing of the mechanism apart, leaving its core exposed.
    & I stared in silent awe, at the busy mechanical concerto playing its own requiem. The arms eventually began to unbuilding the core, growing forever weakly as it dismantled the remaining components, moving them back into the box. This obscene ritual of disembowelment and exposé on pointlessness ended as the tiny arms and the weight had fallen back into the toolbox.

    * Phonology
    & Building words from Lietal's phonemes is called {(bold "Childspeak")}. It makes for long rhythmical and syllabic words, its main usage is in loan words and to express of emphasis or exclamation. This documentation uses the phonetically denser form {(bold "Adultspeak")} where patterns of duplicated consonants and vowels are condensed.
    | CVCV | {(bold "lili")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "lili")} | {(bold "falili")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "falili")} | {(bold "fafalili")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "fafalili")}
    | CVCv | {(bold "lila")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "lila")} | {(bold "falila")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "falila")} | {(bold "fafolila")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "fafolila")}
    | CVcV | {(bold "viki")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "viki")} | {(bold "faviki")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "faviki")} | {(bold "fafoviki")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "fafoviki")}
    | CVcv | {(bold "lika")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "lika")} | {(bold "falika")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "falika")} | {(bold "favolika")} > {(lietal:adultspeak "favolika")}
    & A single syllable of childspeak is reversed, so "vo" becomes <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "vo")}</b>. A sequence of consonant, like "lyla", is condensed into <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lyla")}</b>. A sequence of vowels, like "lara", is condensed into <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lara")}</b>, in which an additional short "{(ital "e")}" is added inbetween the two consonants.
    & When no sequence of consonants or vowels are present, an extra vowel is also added between the consonants, so "lira", is transformed into <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lira")}</b>.
    * Morphology
    & Lietal words are built from the combination of the {(bold "9 Elementary Particles")}, and each one contains a {(ital "consonant & a vowel")}.

    & The order of words {(bold "follows the table of Elementary Particles")}. In a typical sentence, {(bold "traverse")}-type("k") words will be found at the beginning, and {(bold "action")}-type("f") words, at the end.
    & The following sequence of letters is the normal flow of a sentence, {(bold "when a sentence must break the word order, commas are used")}. Notice the word order in the following sentence, and specifically how a comma is used to join two sentences that would normaly break the word order.
    | K | T | D | R | S | L | J | V | F
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "soon" "home" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going home soon."
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "library" "from" "," "home" "to go")}</b>, "I am going home, from the library."
    * Reference
    & {(bold "Traverse")}-type words are meant to navigate a hierarchy, and are often used at the beginning of a sentence. To be {(ital "at a place")}, in Lietal, is made explicit with the "{(lietal:enli "location")}" marker, like <b>{(lietal:enli "location" "school")}</b> for "{(ital "at school")}", and <b>{(lietal:enli "child" "school")}</b> for "{(ital "in school")}".
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "location" "house" "," "soon" "we" "to leave"))}</b>, "We are at the house, we are leaving soon".
    & {(bold "State")}-type words are meant to define the state of existence of something. Where <b>{(lietal:enli "psychologic")}</b> will speak of the idea, or concept of a thing, <b>{(lietal:enli "phisionomic")}</b> will speak of the shape of a thing, and <b>{(lietal:enli "physic")}</b> will speak of the thing itself. The difference can be better explained when used in an action, or with the examples: <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "fiti")}</b>({(lietal:lien "fiti")}), <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "fita")}</b>({(lietal:lien "fita")}) & <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "fito")}</b>({(lietal:lien "fito")}).
    & {(bold "Scale")}-type words are used to define things that are made <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "do")}</b>(machines, products), from life-itself <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "da")}</b>(fauna, flora) and from things that makes life <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "di")}</b>(time, space).
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "home" "future" "to be"))}</b>, "I will be at home"
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "you" "future" "to see"))}</b>, "I will see you later"
    & {(bold "Direction")}-type words are used to change the attributes of a concept, to transition toward something other or to create a conceptual arrow.
    & {(bold "Relation")}-type words will most often be used as particles to create the equivalence of English particles "{(ital "and")}" and "{(ital "with")}", or to create enumerations.
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "between" "you" "i"))}</b>, "Between you and I"
    & {(bold "Counter")}-type words are often used to create subject pronouns, or parts of larger concepts like months in a year, or an item in a series. A sentence, by default, is expected to be {(bold "at the 1st person")}, if a pronoun has not already been declared, pronouns are often omitted when possible. The basic Lietal singular pronouns are <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lari")}</b>({(lietal:lien "lari")}), <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lara")}</b>({(lietal:lien "lara")}), <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "laro")}</b>({(lietal:lien "laro")}). The basic plural pronouns are <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "liri")}</b>({(lietal:lien "liri")}), <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "lira")}</b>({(lietal:lien "lira")}), <b>{(lietal:adultspeak "liro")}</b>({(lietal:lien "liro")}).
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "i" "to go"))}</b>, "I am going"
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "they" "to go"))}</b>, "They are going"
    & {(bold "Modality")}-type words are usually used to create words like "couldn't", "could", "must", or <b>{(lietal:enli "could not")}</b>, <b>{(lietal:enli "could")}</b>, <b>{(lietal:enli "must")}</b>.
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "must" "where" "to go"))}</b>, "Where must I go?"
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "could" "who" "to be"))}</b>, "Who might you be?"
    & {(bold "Alignment")}-type words are used to express a standing on a specific topic, for example, to express that something is wanted or not. Many of the daily expressions of greetings are also created from <b>{(lietal:enli "positive")}</b>, for example, <b>{(lietal:enli "welcome")}</b>(welcome) is made from <b>{(lietal:enli "positive")}</b>(positive) & <b>{(lietal:enli "inward")}</b>(inward). This pattern can be expanded to mean things like <b>{(lietal:enli "well done")}</b>(well done), or even <b>{(lietal:enli "health")}</b>(health).
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "welcome" "how"))}?</b>, "Hello, how are you?"
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "bye" "," "soon" "to see")}!</b>, "Good Bye, see you soon!"
    & {(bold "Action")}-type words are usually used at the end of a sentence and are generally built from the {(ital "fy")} family. The sentence "I take the book home" is translated to <b>{(lietal:enli "child" "book" "home" "to take")}</b>, following the {(code "K T F")} structure. Or another example, "I give you the book", could be translated to <b>{(lietal:enli "child" "book" "you" "to give")}</b>, following the {(code "K T L F")} structure.
    - <b>Lietal {(lietal:enli "possible" "to understand")}?</b>, "Can you understand Lietal?".
    - <b>{(cc (lietal:enli "child" "home" "to welcome"))}</b>, "I welcome you home".

    & I have formatted this guide to be a study tool prior to moving to {(link "Japan")} a few years ago, it requires the knowledge to {(bold "read Hiragana, Katakana and basic kanjis")}.
    * Sentence Word Order
    & In general, the main verb is found at the end of the sentence. Subjects are shown in grey as they are very often omitted. The preposition follows the noun, it is more properly called a postposition(て、に、お、は). They are not independent words but particles by which the case of nouns is determined.
    @ I'm going to give a present to my teacher tomorrow at school.
    | <span style='color:#999'>Subject</span>  | {(bold "Time")}   | {(bold "Place")}    | {(bold "Indirect")} | {(bold "Object")}      | {(bold "Action Verb")}
    | <span style='color:#999'>私は</span>      | 明日   | 学校で     | 先生に    | プレゼントを   | <b>上げます</b>
    | <span style='color:#999'>わたくしは</span> | あした  | がっこうで | せんせいに  | ぷれぜんとを | <b>あげます</b>
    * Particles
    - Use は after the subject, if a {(bold "new subject is introduced")} where another had been previously understood. If a subject is understood, but for some reason not deleted use が, or nothing.
    - Use に to indicate a specific points in {(bold "time")}, a word like "tomorrow"（明日） can only be understood by context and does not need the particle added. Like "In October", or 十月に — or like "On March 3rd", or 三月三日に. <b>Indirect objects</b> are also followed by に, similar to the english expression "to you", as seen in the following sentence "I'm going to give this book to you.", or この本をあなたに上げる.
    - Use で after the {(bold "place")} you do something or the {(bold "thing")} you use to do something. For example, "Going by car", is 車で行く.
    - Use を after a noun to declare an {(bold "object")}, as seen in the following sentence "I'm reading a book", or 本を読んでいる.
    - Use も to <b>add extra info</b> on top of what has already been declared, not unlike the english word "too", as in "me too". For example, "I'm going too", is ぼくも行く.
    - Use の to indicate {(bold "possession")} after an object, similarly to the english possession particle "'s", as in "Alex's". For example, "This is my book" is これはぼくの本です.
    - Use か at the end of a sentence to create a {(bold "question")}, as in "What time is it?", or 何時ですか? Or, between {(bold "choices")}, each choice is also followed by か. As in "Today or tomorrow?", or 今日か明日？
    - Use ね after a verb to create a sort of {(bold "agreement")} with the listener, not unlike the english expression "isn't?", in "It's fun isn't it?", or たのうしいですね.
    * Nouns
    & Nouns have no inflection to indicate singularity or plurality, for example, こども means both child and children. When wishing to show the plural of a noun, an indicator such as ーら、ーたち are attached, as in こどもたち, meaning children. Generally, the plural distinction is not made, but is left to be understood from the context.
    * Adjectives
    & Adjectives always end in あい, いい, うい or おい, never in えい that would be a noun. Basically, you replace the ending い to inflect.
    | 優しい | やさしい | It's nice
    | 優しくない | やさしくない | It's not nice
    | 優しかった | やさしかった | It was nice
    | 優しかったら | やさしかったら | If it's nice
    * Verbs
    & The ーる verbs that end in like たべる and いれる. There is always an い or an え before ーる. For these verbs, everything is done by dropping or replacing ーる with something else.
    | {(ital "食べ")}る | Eating
    | {(ital "食べ")}ます | (Polite)
    | {(ital "食べ")}て | Gerund
    | {(ital "食べ")}た | I ate it.
    | {(ital "食べ")}やすい | This is easy to eat.
    | {(ital "食べ")}たら | If I/someone eats.
    | {(ital "食べ")}たり | I did things like eating
    | {(ital "食べ")}れば | If I/someone eats.
    | {(ital "食べ")}よう | Let's eat.
    | {(ital "食べ")}ろ | Eat dammit!
    | {(ital "食べ")}ないでよ | Don't eat that!
    | {(ital "食べ")}られる | I can eat
    | {(ital "食べ")}られるない | I can't eat this!
    | {(ital "食べ")}させる | Make someone do
    | {(ital "食べ")}させない　で　よ | Don't make me eat this!
    | {(ital "食べ")}させられる | Be made to eat
    & These verbs end in う, く, ぐ, ぶ, む, ぬ, す, つ, or ある・いる・うる・える・おる. Typically you drop ーう and add something else. The problem is that there might be a phonetic change, such as when は becomes ぱ, or た becomes だ.
    | {(bold "talk")}  | はな   | 話す  | 話して | 話しった  | 話したら   | 話せ | 話さない | 話せる
    | {(bold "walk")}  | きく   | きく　 | きいて  | 聞いた   | 聞いたら | 聞け | 聞かない  | 聞ける
    | {(bold "swim")}  | およぐ  | 泳ぐ | 泳いでる | 泳いだ   | 泳いだら | 泳げ | 泳がない | 泳げる
    | {(bold "call")}  | よび   | 呼ぶ　 | 呼んで  | 呼んだ   | 呼んだら | 呼べ  | 呼ばない  | 呼べる
    | {(bold "drink")} | ぬも   | 飲む　 | 飲んで  | 飲んだ   | 飲んだら | 飲め  | 飲まない  | 飲める
    | {(bold "die")}   | しぬ   | 死ぬ　 | 死んで  | 死んだ   | 死んだら | 死ね  | 死なない  | 死ねる
    | {(bold "make")}  | つくる | 作る　 | 作って | つ作った  | 作ったら | 作れ | 作らない | 作れる
    | {(bold "wait")}  | まて   | 待つ　 | 待って  | 待った   | 待ったら |  | 待たない | 待てる
    | {(bold "pay")}   | はらう  | 払う | 払って | 払った  | 払ったら | 払え | 払わない | 払える
    & There are some ーう verbs that end in ーる like ある(to be), おる(to break) and うる(to sell) are ーう verbs as they do not have an い or え sound before ーる.
    & If you see one that ends in ーいる or ーえる, and ーう changes to add ーます, or the "t" doubles to get a gerund (入る「はいる」　＞　入って「はいって」), then you're dealing with an ーう verb.
    & Most books say that there are only two irregular verbs in all of Japanese: する and 来る「くる」. Those you have to memorize separately, but they kind of make sense when you look at them.
    | 来る | will come                        | する　 | will do
    | 来て | come here                        | して　 | do this
    | 来た | someone came                     | した　 | someone did
    | 来たら | if someone comes                | したら | if someone does
    | 来たり | do things like come             | したり　 | do things like doing
