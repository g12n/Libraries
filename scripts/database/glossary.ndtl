  False consensus effect : Tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.

  Mind projection fallacy : Assumption that the way you see the world reflects the way the world really is.
  Typical mind fallacy : Assumption that other people are more like you than they actually are.
  Fallacy of gray : Assumption that because nothing is certain, everything is equally uncertain. It does not take into account that some things are more certain than others.
  The Sophisticate : "The world isn't black and white. No one does pure good or pure bad. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else." The Zetet: "Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color view."

  Truth effect : Tendency to identify as true statements familiar statements over unfamiliar ones.
  Clustering : Tendency to perceive patterns where actually none exist.
  Frequency : Tendency to notice something everywhere after having learnt about it. Also known as the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon.
  Transparency : Tendency to overestimate others' ability to know them, and they also overestimate their ability to know others. Misleading impression that your words convey more to others than they really do.
  Anti-inductiveness : The idea that the market would stop being efficient if everyone acted like it already was efficient.

  Alief : An independent source of emotional reaction which can coexist with a contradictory belief. Example The fear felt when a monster jumps out of the darkness in a scary movie is based on the alief that the monster is about to attack you, even though you believe that it cannot.
  Proper belief : Requires observations, gets updated upon encountering new evidence, and provides practical benefit in anticipated experience.
  Improper belief : Is a belief that isn't concerned with describing the territory. Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a lottery ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.
  Belief in belief : Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. Were you to really believe and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe. When someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief, and belief in belief, have become unsynchronized.
  A Priori : Knowledge which we can be sure of without any empirical evidence(evidence from our senses). So, knowledge that you could realize if you were just a mind floating in a void unconnected to a body.

; Software Design
DARK PATTERNS
  Bait and Switch : You set out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.

  Disguised Ads : Adverts that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get you to click on them.
  Forced Continuity : When your free trial with a service comes to an end and your credit card silently starts getting charged without any warning.
  Friend Spam : The product asks for your email, or social media permissions, under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.
  Hidden Costs : You get to the last step of the checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges have appeared, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc.
  Misdirection : The design purposefully focuses your attention on one thing in order to distract you attention from another.
  Price Comparison Prevention : The retailer makes it hard for you to compare the price of an item with another item, so you cannot make an informed decision.
  Privacy Zuckering : You are tricked into publicly sharing more information about yourself than you really intended to.
  Roach Motel : The design makes it very easy for you to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for you to get out of it (e.g. a subscription).
  Sneak into Basket : You attempt to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into your basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page.
  Trick Questions : You respond to a question, which, when glanced upon quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks another thing entirely.

  Anti-Pattern : A common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.
  Worse Is Better : The idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

  The Cathedral model : The source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of developers.
  The Bazaar model : The source code is developed over the Internet in view of the public.
  XY Problem : You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y.

  Benevolent Dictator For Life : A open-source software development practice where project founders retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community.
  Yak Shaving : Refers to a task, that leads you to perform another related task and so on, and so on — all distracting you from your original goal.
